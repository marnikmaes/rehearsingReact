# rehearsingReact
This repository serves as a dummy platform for practicing my React skills. It is not intended for use in any project and is solely for demonstration purposes.

## Project Setup
Setting up the project is incredibly simple and involves just three commands.

1. Run `npm create vite@latest` to create a new Vite project. When prompted, follow these options:
   - Project name: Enter `.` to use the current folder.
   - Project package: Keep the default option.
   - Framework: Choose React using the arrow keys.
   - Variant: Select JavaScript with SWC, which offers slightly faster performance than plain JavaScript.
2. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies 
3. Run `npm run dev` to get the application started
